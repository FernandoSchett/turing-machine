## Developed by 💻:

- [Fernando Schettini](https://linktr.ee/fernandoschett).

## About 🤔:

The GitHub project introduces two Turing Machines, MT1 and MT2, designed to calculate the arrival time at a destination based on flight duration, departure time, departure meridian, and arrival meridian (in degrees, with east and west indicators) all these parameters are represented in unary base. More details at the [report]().

## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- MT1: classic single-tape Turing Machine it processes input data on a single tape to determine the arrival time at the destination.

- MT2: a new machine that introduces a two-tape Turing Machine with enhanced parallel processing capabilities. With dual tapes and transitions from the final state, MT2 show a simple example of how it can provide flexibility and computational efficiency.
